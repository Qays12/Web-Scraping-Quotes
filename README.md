# Web-Scraping-Quotes
I decided to do some web scraping using a website that allowed itself to be scrapped.

I had a look at how many pages the website had of quotes by its author, and the contents were around 10 pages. Anything higher didn't get a 404 error, but rather a page saying no quotes found.
I decided to get all the quotes and its authors from every page that was available. I used the no quotes found page to stop the script once it landed on that page. 
I printed the quote next to its author.
