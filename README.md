# Web-Scraping-Quotes
I decided to do some web scraping using a website that allowed itself to be scrapped.

I had a look at how many pages the website has of quotes by its author and the contents are around 10 pages. Anything higher didnt resolve it a 404 error but rather a page saying no quotes found.
I decided to get all the quotes and its authors from every page that was available. I used to no quotes found page to stop the script once it landed on that page. 
I printed the quote next to its author.
